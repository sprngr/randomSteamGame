At that point I figured why not make it just\r\na simple button to click rather than copy in code each time; it kind of evolved from there.\r\n\r\n###Features\r\n\r\n- Lets you enter a steamID if you are too lazy to go to the page before clicking the bookmark.\r\n- Highlights and scrolls to the game it has just selected for you.\r\n- Adds a handy launch button to start the game right away.\r\n- Bookmarklet calls latest code from here so you never have to worry about updating what you have.\r\n- Excludes any apps not of type \"game\" as well as Steam for Linux (Not sure why it's listed as a game)\r\n\r\n###Future Updates\r\n\r\nUnknown at this time, too busy playing games. Feel free to give any suggestions.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
